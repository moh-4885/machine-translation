# Machine Translation for Date Formats

This project explores a machine translation model to convert dates between different formats using synthetic data generated with the Faker library. This is achieved using a neural network model with LSTM layers for sequence-to-sequence translation.
## Introduction

The project aims to translate date formats from one locale to another, using a deep learning model. By generating synthetic dates with diverse formats, we can train and evaluate a model capable of performing these translations with high accuracy.
Requirements

## Install dependencies via:

``` bash

pip install faker babel tqdm tensorflow
```
# Usage

To run the notebook, start by generating synthetic data:

- Generate Date Data: Using Faker, we create date objects in various formats.
-  - Train Model: A sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM layers trains on the date data.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes:

   - Bidirectional LSTM layers for effective sequence encoding.
  - Dense and Attention layers for improved translation accuracy.

## Results

The model demonstrates good accuracy in translating date formats across different locales. Evaluation metrics and sample translations are available in the notebook.
